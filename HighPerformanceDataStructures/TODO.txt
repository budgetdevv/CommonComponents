It looks like you can use inheritance to create byref and byvalue versions of the TrinaryIndex
You can check the algorithms again, but I believe everywhere where you would have to toggle between byref EmptySlotTest or byref EmptySlotSet versus by value,
you can justify an if test, becuase the cost will be miniscule since its before a loop..
There may be only one or two cases where it could matter... BUT:
I think you could just capture the behavior you want to switch on in a delegate in the constructor and then you're never branching during runtime.
Also using inheritance, you can create different constructor to accept the byref or byvalue delegates you need
